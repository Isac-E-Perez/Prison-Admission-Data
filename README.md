# Prison Admission Data Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used the libraries tidyr, dplyr, plotly and ggplot2 which helped me to build the project. I analyzed data of various prison data to gain a better understanding and insight of general trends of prison immates and convictions. 
 
### Results: 

First, I loaded the datasets onto data frames.

I inspected the datasets with the functions *head* to gain insight in what I wanted to gleam from the data and extract from it.


Afterwards, I viewed the data to see what I am working with.

The average number of offenders was 458.25 persons in facilities. 

I also looked into the standard deviation of the number of offenders in the residential facilities.
